# Zounds: A Values-Based Reflection Quiz

**Zounds** is an interactive, visually expressive quiz that invites users to explore their alignment with values like Love, Honor, Duty, and Reason â€” inspired by classical literature, philosophy, and theater.

Users answer a series of questions and receive a plotted chart of their values, normalized and visualized on a 2D graph. The app also tracks response statistics and stores submissions via Supabase.
